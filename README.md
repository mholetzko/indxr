# indxr
A simple - indexing it all tool

# Why INDXR

Assume you have a document ... 
And you would like to ...

Find it again
Share it with colleagues
Receive shared docs from colleagues
Build doc sets

... all from a terminal with a minimal API ?

indxr create -> creates a local index file
indxr login  -> you may login to the remote db
indxr find   -> regex-pattern from an indexed document
indxr inbox  -> shows all received and not yet accepted docs
indxr sendto -> share a document with another indxr user
indxr set    -> creates a doc set
indxr add    -> adds a doc
indxr rm     -> removes a doc

... then you should wait for indxr :)
